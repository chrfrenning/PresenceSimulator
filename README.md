# PresenceSimulator
Tired of your computer sleeping too often and instant messaging apps marking you 'away' while you're doing work on another computer or just having a conversation? This little utility simulates your presence to ensure others can reach you.

### How it does it

The app fakes a keyboard click of Function Key 24 every 30 minutes.

## Update, 9 Mar 2020

* Time to update this file, many small improvements
* Main change: video or keypress simulation
* UX cleanups, code still ugly bugly
* Releases through GitHub, binaries and source code available for download

## Update, 28 Feb 2020

* Predefined 1, 3, 6, 12 hours timeouts in context enable menu

## Update, 27 Feb 2020

* Application now starts to tray icon (look for star icon)
* Try icon context menu for enable, disable, settings, quit
* Presence simulation stops after 60 minutes, time is adjustable in settings
* Mushroom / Star icons in tray

## Future

* Testing video playing APIs to see if simulated keyboard click mechanism now used can be replaced. Clicks can interrupt other actions if you work while having the simulator enabled.
