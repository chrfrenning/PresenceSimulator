# PresenceSimulator
Tired of your computer sleeping too often and instant messaging apps marking you 'away' while you're doing work on another computer or just having a conversation? This little utility simulates your presence to ensure others can reach you.

### How it does it

The app fakes a keyboard click of Function Key 24 every 30 minutes.

## Update, 27 Feb 2020

* Application now starts to tray icon (look for star icon)
* Try icon context menu for enable, disable, settings, quit
* Presence simulation stops after 60 minutes, time is adjustable in settings

## Future

* Testing video playing APIs to see if simulated keyboard click mechanism now used can be replaced. Clicks can interrupt other actions if you work while having the simulator enabled.

Must enable feature to control default timeout (now 60m)
